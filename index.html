       <div class="post-content">
         <p>Begining my first project and my first step into the world of
           programming has been very fullfulling and being able to make somethnig
           original is a massive step into becoming succsesffull</p>
           <p>The best part of this project is going to be showing it of to all my
             retarted friends.</p>
             <p>Whilst creating this website it gave and is giving me a calmness
             in knowing that nobody can change or judge what i am doing, and I
           have built a wall between the negatives and positives, whilst focusing
         on only the positives and ackwnawliging the negatives and moving
         on to continue creating and learning about what life has to offer me.
       To anybody reading this I would highly incourage you to step out of your
     comfort zone,as I would not have believed that I would be able to
   learn a brand new line of information and succsefully perfrom it in only
 3-4 days. </p>
